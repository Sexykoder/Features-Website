    <h3>Hello Everyone</h3>
    <h3>I am</h3>
    <h1>Brijamohan Jha</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my Website!!</h2>
    <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree at Jadavpur University, Kolkata and have a strong academic background in engineering and mathematics.  My most recent internship was as a Summer Analyst Intern at Aunwesha Knowledge Technologies Private Limited, where I conducted research on text extraction from CAD files and evaluated APIs to improve accuracy.

In addition to my engineering background, I also have a keen interest in finance. I recently completed an internship as a Financial Analyst Intern at The Investor Co., where I analyzed Nifty 500 large-cap equities and created investment reports with recommendations.

I'm a highly motivated individual with strong communication and research skills. I am also proficient in a variety of programming languages, including Python, C/C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In my free time, I enjoy building applications to solve problems I encounter. I recently created a fully functional BMI calculator and a weather forecasting app. I am also involved in the Jadavpur University Finance Club and served as the Research Co-Head from April 2022 to March 2023.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. If you're looking for a mechanically inclined individual with a developing passion for finance, I'd love to hear from you!
